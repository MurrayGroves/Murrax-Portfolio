Yo, I'm Murrax. I'm currently a student in sixth form studying Further Maths and Computer Science.

I've been programming since <strong>2015</strong>, mainly in <strong>Python</strong> and recently in <strong>Rust</strong>. I play a lot of indie games, often roguelites. If you're looking for a portfolio that isn't only about web3, I have on [here](https://murraygrov.es). Always looking for work so hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MurraxDev) if you're working on anything cool.

# Projects I've worked on
## [Sploot](https://twitter.com/splootnft)
<strong>Sploot</strong> is a role-playing sports metaverse imagined, owned, and played by Splooters using 10,000 on-chain Sploots. Rules are made to be broken.

I've done work with them making a [Discord bot](/crypto/discord/2021/10/26/Eth-Whitelister-Discord-Bot/) for whitelisting. I also made a script for scraping Discord users and roles.
